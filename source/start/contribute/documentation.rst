Contributing to Documenting Kuwaiba from scratch
------------------------------------------------

Kuwaiba documentation is build on ReadTheDocs_ (RTD) platform. That means automatic documentation
deployment with the Sphinx_ engine. To work with that platform you need git_ installed, `github account <github_>`_ and 
`text editor <editor_>`_, working with git. We prefer `VS Code`_, so the following story will be 
in relation with this editor, but you can work with the one of your choice.

.. tip:: 
    If you are new with VS Code, see official videos, covering our needs:
      * Learn Visual Studio Code in 7min (`Official Beginner Tutorial`_)
      * Git: `Commits in Visual Studio Code`_
      * 5 Tips for `Note Taking`_ with VS Code & Git
      * `Pull Requests`_ in VS Code

As far as :hoverxref:`RTD <my-rtd-label>` is using reStructuredText_ (RST) it is considered useful to install an 
extension `reStructuredText by LeXtudio`_ (RTL). Unfortunately the extension is now considered 
for experienced users so we give you :doc:`some breadcrumbs</start/contribute/make_lextudio_work>`.

When you feel comfortable enough with VS Code, you might find useful the official `Sphinx RST Tutorial`_ or
try this `nice video course`_ by chance available on youtube.
