Documentation
=============

We welcome any your support in documenting your Kuwaiba journey in order to share with other users,
and we commit to retain the easy to use and helpful support to start documenting. Don't hesitate to start
writing even if the words github, restructured text and pull request are :doc:`new for you</start/contribute/absolute_beginner>`. Nevertheless
the actual working surrounding is quite comprehensive, we will try to make any small step easier and
let you concentrate on the issue.
